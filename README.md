This is a simple command-line random number guessing game in Python. The game generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user is prompted to guess the number. The game provides hints to help the user guess the number, and the user's score is decreased for each incorrect guess.

## How to Play
1. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 10.
2. The user will be prompted to guess the number.
3. If the user guesses the correct number, the program will print "Damn you are genius" and the game will end.
4. If the user's guess is greater than the random number, the program will print "Nope the number is lesser than [user's guess]" and the user's score will be decreased by 10.
5. If the user's guess is less than the random number, the program will print "Nope the number is greater than [user's guess]" and the user's score will be decreased by 10.
6. If the user's guess is not an integer between 1 and 10, the program will print "Bro I said 1 to 10" and the user's score will be decreased by 10.
7. The game will continue until the user guesses the correct number.
